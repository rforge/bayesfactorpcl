#' General S4 class for representing multiple Bayes factor model comparisons, all against the same model
#' 
#' The \code{BFBayesFactor} class is a general S4 class for representing models model comparison via Bayes factor.
#'   
#'   \code{BFBayesFactor} objects can be inverted by taking the reciprocal and can
#'    be divided by one another, provided both objects have the same denominator. In addition, 
#'    the \code{t} (transpose) method can be used to invert Bayes factor objects.

#'   \describe{
#'   The \code{BFBayesFactor} class has the following slots defined:
#'    \item{numerator}{a list of models all inheriting \code{BFmodel}, each providing a single denominator}
#'    \item{denominator}{a single \code{BFmodel} object serving as the denominator for all model comparisons}
#'    \item{bayesFactor}{a data frame containing information about the comparison between each numerator and the denominator}
#'    \item{data}{a data frame containing the data used for the comparison}
#'    \item{version}{character string giving the version and revision number of the package that the model was created in}
