\title{
Function to start GUI for computing the Bayes factors in an ANOVA design
}
\description{
This function starts a graphical user interface that allows model comparisons with data from ANOVA designs. 
}
\usage{

aovGUI(y, dataFixed=NULL, dataRandom=NULL, iterations = 10000, 
    		rscaleFixed="medium", rscaleRandom=1)
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
	A vector of observations	
}
  \item{dataFixed}{
A data frame containing the fixed factors, one column per factor. Columns will be converted to factors if they are not factors already.
}
  \item{dataRandom}{
A data frame containing the random factors, one column per factor. Columns will be converted to factors if they are not factors already.
}
  \item{iterations}{
Number of Monte Carlo samples to perform (see details).  
}
\item{rscaleFixed}{The prior scale of effect size for factors that are treated as a fixed. A number of preset values are available as strings; see Details in \code{\link{allNways}} for more information.
}
\item{rscaleRandom}{
The prior scale of effect size for factors that are treated as random.}
}

\details{
	Thus function uses the Rook webserver in R to build a user interface. It will open the interface in a new browser window. Instructions for the user interface can be found by clicking 'Help' once the interface starts.
	
	See the help for \code{\link{allNways}} and \code{\link{nWayAOV.MC}} for more details.
