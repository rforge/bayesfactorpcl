\title{
Function to compute the Bayes factors in an ANOVA design
}
\description{
This function computes Bayes factors for all main-effects and interaction contrasts in an ANOVA design. 
}
\usage{
allNways(y, dataFixed = NULL, dataRandom = NULL, iterations = 10000, only.top = TRUE, progress = FALSE, rscaleFixed = .5, rscaleRandom = 1, logbf = FALSE, ...) 
    
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
	A vector of observations	
}
  \item{dataFixed}{
A data frame containing the fixed factors, one column per factor. Columns must be factors
}
  \item{dataRandom}{
A data frame containing the random factors, one column per factor. Columns must be factors
}
  \item{iterations}{
Number of Monte Carlo samples to perform (see details).  
}
  \item{only.top}{
If \code{FALSE}, then all nested submodels will be compared.  If \code{TRUE}, then only the first level of a top-down strategy of comparing submodels missing a single covariate is implemented.  \code{TRUE} is the default because the comparisons are analogous to classical ANOVA, and this option dramatically cuts down the computation time (see details).
}
\item{progress}{
If \code{TRUE}, a text progress bar is displayed for each model analyzed. 
}
\item{rscaleFixed}{The prior scale of effect size for factors that are treated as a fixed.
}
\item{rscaleRandom}{
The prior scale of effect size for factors that are treated as random.}




\item{logbf}{
If \code{TRUE}, return the natural logarithm of the Bayes factor
}
\item{...}{
Additional arguments to pass to \code{\link{nWayAOV.MC}}
}
}

\details{
The models, priors, and methods of computation are provided in Rouder et al. (2012).  	
The ANOVA model for a vector of observations \eqn{y} is
\deqn{ y = \mu + X_1 \theta_1 + \ldots + X_p\theta_p +\epsilon,}
where \eqn{\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_p} are vectors of main-effect and interaction effects, \eqn{X_1,\ldots,X_p} are corresponding design matrices, and \eqn{\epsilon} is a vector of zero-centered noise terms with variance \eqn{\sigma^2}.  Zellner and Siow (1980) inspired g-priors are placed on effects, but with a separate g-prior parameter for each covariate:
\deqn{\theta_1~N(0,g_1\sigma^2), \ldots,  \theta_p~N(0,g_p \sigma^2).}  A Jeffries prior is placed on \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\sigma^2}.  Independent scaled inverse-chi-square priors with one degree of freedom are placed on \eqn{g_1,\ldots,g_p}.  The square-root of the scale for g's corresponding to fixed and random effects is given by \code{rscaleFixed} and \code{rscaleRandom}, respectively.

When a factor is treated as random, there are as many main effect terms in the vector \eqn{\theta} as levels.  When a factor is treated as fixed, the sums-to-zero linear constraint is enforced by centering the corresponding design matrix, and there is one fewer main effect terms as levels.  The Cornfield-Tukey model of interactions is assumed.  Details are provided in Rouder et al. (2012)

Bayes factors are computed by integrating the likelihood with respect to the priors on parameters.  The integration of all parameters except \eqn{g_1,\ldots,g_p} may be expressed in closed-form; the integration of \eqn{g_1,\ldots,g_p} is performed through Monte Carlo sampling, and \code{iterations} is the number of iterations used to estimate the Bayes factor.  

\code{allNways} computes Bayes factors for either all submodels or select submodels missing a single main effect or covariate, depending on the argument \code{only.top}.  Bayes factors for specific models are computed by \code{\link{nWayAOV.MC}}, an options to this back-end function may be passed.  See \code{\link{nWayAOV.MC}} for more details.

If no random factors are specified, the null model assumed by \code{allNways} is the grand-mean only model. If random factors are specified, the null model is the model with all random factors plus a grand mean. Thus, \code{allNways} cannot currently be used to test random factors. Testing random factors is possible with \code{\link{nWayAOV.MC}}.

\section{Warning }{
The function \code{allNways} will compute Bayes factors for all possible combinations of fixed factors and interactions, against the null hypothesis that \emph{all} effects are 0. The total number of tests computed will be \eqn{2^{2^K - 1}}{2^(2^K - 1)} for \eqn{K} fixed factors. This number increases very quickly with the number of factors. For instance, for a five-way ANOVA, the total number of tests exceeds two billion. Even though each test takes a fraction of a second, the time taken for all tests could exceed your lifetime.

It is possible to reduce the number of models tested by only testing the most complex model and every restriction that can be formed by removing one factor or interaction using the \code{only.top} argument. This reduces the number of tests to \eqn{2^K-1}, which is more manageable. The Bayes factor for each restriction against the most complex model can be interpreted as a test of the removed factor/interaction. If other tests are required besides those provided by \code{only.top}, they can be obtained via the function \code{nWayAOV.MC}.

## traditional ANOVA gives a p value of 0.00283

## Gives a Bayes factor of about 11.6
