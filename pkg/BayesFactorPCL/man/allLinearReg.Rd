\title{
Function to compute the Bayes factors in a regression design
}
\description{
This function computes Bayes factors for all models in a regression design
}
\usage{
allLinearReg(y, covariates, extraInfo = FALSE, progress = FALSE, 
             rscale = 1, logbf = FALSE, ...)
    
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
	A vector of observations	
}
\item{covariates}{
A data frame containing the covariates, one column per covariate. 
}
\item{extraInfo}{
  If \code{TRUE}, return a data frame containing useful information. If \code{FALSE}, only the Bayes factors are returned. 
}
\item{progress}{
If \code{TRUE}, a text progress bar is displayed. A callback function may also be supplied.
}
\item{rscale}{The prior scale on standardized effect size.
}
\item{logbf}{
If \code{TRUE}, return the natural logarithm of the Bayes factor
}
\item{...}{
Additional arguments to pass to \code{\link{linearReg.Quad}} (currently unused)
}
}

\details{
The models, priors, and methods of computation are provided in Liang et al. (2008). See \code{\link{linearReg.Quad}} for more details. 
}

\value{
If \code{extraInfo} is \code{FALSE}, a vector of Bayes factors, each measuring the support for a model relative to the null model. 

If \code{extraInfo} is \code{TRUE}, a data frame whose three columns are the Bayes factors, R-squared, and number of covariates respectively. Each row is a different model, as indicated by the corresponding row name.

\section{Warning }{
The function \code{allLinearReg} will compute Bayes factors for all combinations of covariates. The total number of models tested will be \eqn{2^K - 1}{2^K - 1} for \eqn{K} covariates. For example, with 16 covariates, over 65,000 models will be tested. Even though each test takes a fraction of a second, for large numbers of covariates the function could take a long time time to finish. Use the \code{progress} argument to keep an eye on the function's progress.

\examples{
## See help(attitude) for details about the data set
data(attitude)

## Classical regression
summary(fm1 <- lm(rating ~ ., data = attitude))

## Compute Bayes factors for all regression models
allLinearReg(y = attitude$rating, covariates = attitude[,-1])
## Best model is 'complaints' only

## Output extra info, and compute all Bayes factors against full model
output <- allLinearReg(y = attitude$rating, covariates = attitude[,-1], extraInfo = TRUE)
output$bf <- output$bf / output$bf[which.max(output$p)]

## What are the top models?
