	This interface is experimental. Certain features may not work properly. The underlying code which computes the Bayes factors has been well-tested, but this interface has not. The issues will be addressed over time, but the interface is made available in this early state for your convenience and testing purposes. Some known issues: 
	<ul>
	<li>Avoid closing the interface while an analysis is working. Wait until an analysis is done before quitting.</li>
	<li>Do not delete an analysis while processing is occurring.</li>
	<li>Adding new analyses while analyses are ongoing will queue the new analyses, but they will not be analyzed (the queueing is not fully operational). You may safely delete these.</li>
	</ul>
